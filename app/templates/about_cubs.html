            <h4>Wolf cubs, as they were originally called, use Jungle Book as their theme. The group is organised into Sixes, with each six assigned a different colour woggle. Cubs are aged eight to ten and a half years. Cubs wear a dark green sweatshirt or Polo shirt with the cub logo at the bottom left hand side.</h4>
            <h4>Cubs do a variety of activities including camping outside, many for the first time ever, this is an exciting prospect for a young eight year old. Other activities include playing games, working towards badges for joining in, recognition or activities. The highest badge a cub can get is the Silver Scout award, which is earned by completing several activities including cooking outdoors, again many young cubs will be doing this for the first time.</h4>
            <h4>The cost of attending Cubs is £2 per week (the first 4 weeks are free) and once invested Cub uniforms can be purchased from West Leeds Scout Shop (our necker is black with a white border).</h4>
            <h4>1st Woodhall group is led by Akela, and assisted by Baloo, Raksha, Ziggy and Louie. We have a large group of Cubs but always welcome new youths into the scout movement. If you are interested in your child joining cubs, either contact us or come along to the church on Tuesday evening 6.15pm to 7:50pm.</h4>
